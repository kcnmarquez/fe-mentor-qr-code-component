## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### Useful resources

- [CSS Layout - Horizontal & Vertical Align](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This is a useful list of how to vertically and horizontally align elements. I previously used `position` and `transform` but then realized that using flexbox seemed like a cleaner solution.
- [CSS Width 100% and Position Absolute or Fixed](https://fritzthecat-blog.blogspot.com/2016/05/css-width-100-and-position-absolute-or.html) - This helped me figure out why having `width: 100%` on an element with `position: fixed` overflows out of the screen.
